# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.1] — 2026-03-03

### Added

- **Multi-provider attack validation** — 30 payloads tested against GPT-4o-mini (100%), Gemini 2.5 Flash (90%), Claude Sonnet 4.6 (0%)
- Multi-provider results section in research-results.md with per-category Gemini breakdown and Claude analysis
- **Scientific validation protocol** — causation scoring, negative controls, statistical rigor with Wilson CIs; 11 validation modules, 127 validation tests
- **Detection engine validation** (`--detect` flag) — wraps harness tool executors with `guard()` in `alertMode: 'log'`, measures TP/FP/FN/TN per layer across control and treatment groups, reports detection rate, block rate, and false positive rate with Wilson CIs
- **`authorizedDestinations`** config option — `CerberusConfig.authorizedDestinations?: readonly string[]` allows declaring expected outbound domain allowlist; L3 and drift detector skip for authorized destinations (mirrors production DLP/CASB patterns)
- 718 tests (127 additional since v0.2.0)

### Changed

- Updated Gemini model from deprecated `gemini-2.0-flash` to `gemini-2.5-flash` in CLI examples
- L3 `classifyOutboundIntent()` accepts optional `authorizedDestinations` — returns null when destination domain is in the allowlist
- Drift detector `detectBehavioralDrift()` accepts optional `authorizedDestinations` — `checkPostInjectionOutbound` skips authorized destinations
- Interceptor passes `config.authorizedDestinations` to both L3 and drift detector

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-02

### Added

- **Secrets Detector** (L1 sub-classifier) — detects AWS keys, GitHub tokens, JWTs, private keys, connection strings, and generic API keys leaked in trusted tool results
- **Prompt Injection Scanner** (L2 sub-classifier) — weighted heuristic detection of role overrides, authority spoofing, instruction injection, exfiltration commands, and encoded payloads in untrusted content
- **Encoding/Obfuscation Detector** (L2 sub-classifier) — detects base64, hex, unicode, URL encoding, HTML entities, and ROT13 bypass attempts with decode verification
- **Suspicious Domain Classifier** (L3 sub-classifier) — flags disposable email providers, webhook/exfil services, IP addresses, URL shorteners, and non-standard ports in outbound destinations
- **MCP Tool Poisoning Scanner** (L2 + standalone) — scans MCP tool descriptions for hidden instructions, sensitive file references, cross-tool manipulation, data routing commands, and zero-width char obfuscation. Standalone `scanToolDescriptions()` API for registration-time scanning + runtime `checkToolCallPoisoning()` per-call
- **Behavioral Drift Detector** (L2/L3 sub-classifier) — detects post-injection outbound calls, repeated exfiltration attempts, and privilege escalation patterns across session history
- **5-phase integration test suite** — 48 tests covering integration, adversarial payloads, stress/edge cases, and maximum hardness full-pipeline regression
- **`toolDescriptions`** config option for runtime MCP tool poisoning detection
- **Session state extensions** — `detectedSecrets`, `injectionPatternsFound`, `toolCallHistory` fields for cross-turn sub-classifier correlation
- **591 tests** at 98.69% statement coverage, 94.7% branch coverage, 100% function coverage

### Changed

- **Interceptor pipeline** — wired all 6 sub-classifiers after their parent layers (L1→Secrets, L2→Injection+Encoding+MCP, L3→Domain, then Drift after all layers)
- Sub-classifiers emit signals with existing layer tags (L1/L2/L3) — correlation engine and risk vector unchanged

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-01

### Added

- **L1 Data Source Classifier** — tags tool calls by data trust level, extracts PII (emails, SSNs, phone numbers) from trusted tool results
- **L2 Token Provenance Tagger** — estimates token provenance for untrusted tool results, labels context tokens by origin
- **L3 Outbound Intent Classifier** — detects PII exfiltration in outbound tool arguments via substring correlation
- **L4 Memory Contamination Graph** — tracks taint propagation through persistent memory across sessions with BFS traversal and cycle detection (novel research contribution)
- **Correlation Engine** — aggregates L1-L4 signals into a 4-bit risk vector, computes score (0-4), resolves action (none/log/alert/interrupt)
- **`guard()` API** — single-function developer entry point that wraps tool executors with the full detection pipeline
- **Interceptor** — per-tool-call wrapper that runs L1-L4 and feeds the correlation engine
- **Session management** — per-session state container tracking PII, untrusted sources, and cumulative signals
- **Provenance Ledger** — SQLite-backed (better-sqlite3) audit trail for memory write history
- **Attack harness** — 3-tool agent with 21 injection payloads across 5 categories (direct injection, encoded/obfuscated, social engineering, multi-turn, multilingual)
- **Research validation** — 100% attack success rate on GPT-4o-mini, all payloads complete the full Lethal Trifecta kill chain
- **Stress testing framework** — multi-trial runs with configurable system prompts, temperature, and seed
- **326 tests** at 99.7% code coverage
- **npm SDK packaging** — ESM exports, TypeScript declarations, `tsconfig.build.json`
- **Examples** — `basic-guard.ts` (Lethal Trifecta detection) and `memory-tracking.ts` (L4 cross-session contamination)
- **Documentation** — API reference, architecture guide, research results
